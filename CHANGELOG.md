# Changelog

Notable changes to Bay, newest first.

Consumers pin a framework version in `.bay-version` and move with
`bin/bay update`. Read the entries between your pinned version and the latest
before upgrading — anything needing manual action is called out under
**Upgrade notes**.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-08-24

Post-launch hygiene pass over the public tree.

### Security
- `debug_agent` no longer grants root by accident. The `docker` group is
  gone from the default groups (it is root-equivalent); opt back in with
  `debug_agent_docker_access: true`, documented as "this is root". The bare
  `cat`/`tail`/`head`/`grep`/`journalctl`/`systemctl` sudo entries — which
  allowed `sudo cat /etc/shadow` and a `!sh` root shell from the pager —
  are replaced by four argument-validated wrappers: `bay-readlog`
  (paths limited to `debug_agent_readable_paths`), `bay-journal`,
  `bay-systemctl-ro` and `bay-docker-ro` (all `--no-pager`, read-only
  verbs only). Sudo target narrowed from `(ALL)` to `(root)` with
  `env_reset`, `secure_path` and `!use_pty`.
- `files/hooks/validate-ssh.sh` is now deny-by-default: it parses the
  command, refuses chaining, `-J`, `-F`, `-e`, `ProxyCommand`/`ProxyJump`/
  `User` options, and checks every `user@host` token. It was previously
  bypassed by any command containing the string `debugbot@`. The docs now
  describe it as a client-side guard, not a security boundary.

### Changed
- `scripts/leak-scan.sh` closes five blind spots found by planting test
  leaks: case-insensitive and apex-domain hostname matching, base64 in the
  entropy check, an IPv6 section, a long-hex section, and a tracked-junk
  check; the `vendor/` exclusion now applies only to the entropy sections.
- Internal tracker IDs (`M85`-style) removed from docs, comments and tests.
- Small identity scrub: LICENSE holder, example usernames, one ADR incident
  narrative.

### Upgrade notes
- `debug_agent` lives in `provision.yml`: run
  `bin/bay provision <env> --tags users,agent-debug`.
- If your agent relied on `sudo cat`/`sudo tail`/`sudo docker ps`, switch
  it to `sudo bay-readlog`, `sudo bay-journal`, `sudo bay-docker-ro`.
  A consumer that overrides `debug_agent_sudoers_commands` or
  `debug_agent_groups` keeps its own list — and its own exposure.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-24

First public release.

Bay had a long private life before this tag — roughly 340 releases of it. The
version line restarts at 0.1.0 because this is the first release anyone
outside its original operator could actually use, and it would be dishonest to
present a 1.x number as a stability promise to a public that has never run it.
The code is mature; the public contract is new.

### What Bay does

Provisions and operates hardened Docker hosts with Ansible and a Python CLI:

- **Declarative service surface.** One `services.yml` describes every app and
  accessory — domains, ports, env, secrets, health checks, log retention.
- **Traefik ingress** in host-network mode, so services see real client IPs,
  with automatic TLS.
- **Access gateways.** `none` for a plain public deploy, `wireguard` for
  hand-configured peers, or self-hosted `headscale` for a managed tailnet with
  split-DNS, ACLs and per-device identity. All three sit behind one adapter
  contract; see `docs/access-gateways.md`.
- **CrowdSec and nftables** for intrusion detection and firewalling.
- **A server-side reconciler** that diffs desired against running container
  state instead of re-applying everything each deploy.
- **Build pipeline** with local, remote and registry strategies, a self-hosted
  Zot registry, and a webhook receiver for push-to-deploy.
- **Alerting** with a single registry of alert IDs and severities, fanned out
  to Telegram or any webhook adapter.
- **Restic backups**, multi-region deploys, and cross-region service links.
